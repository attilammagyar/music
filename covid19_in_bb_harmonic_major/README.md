CoVID-19 in Bb Harmonic Major
=============================

A song exploring the C<sup>o</sup>-vi<sup>o</sup>-D and C<sup>o</sup>-V-I-D-I9
chord progressions in Bb Harmonic Major, because sitting at home in
self-isolation while playing around with music theory is slightly better than
sitting at home in self-isolation in fear and anxiety. :-)

Recording is available at [SoundCloud][sc].

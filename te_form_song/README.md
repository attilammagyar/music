TE-form song (cover)
====================

The TE-form song is a mnemonic which helps remembering the conjugation rules
for the conjunctive and plain past forms of Japanese verbs depending on the
last syllable of their ~masu stem. The song is based on an American western
folk ballad titled "Oh My Darling, Clementine" (Percy Montrose / Barker
Bradford). The lyrics aren't actually meaningful in Japanese, it's just a
conjugation chart which is easier to learn using the melody:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>～ます stem</th><th>～て form</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>～い、～ち、～り</td><td>～って</td></tr>
    <tr><td>～に、～び、～み</td><td>～んで</td></tr>
    <tr><td>～き</td><td>～いて</td></tr>
    <tr><td>～ぎ</td><td>～いで</td></tr>
    <tr><td>～し</td><td>～して</td></tr>
    <tr><td>します</td><td>して</td></tr>
    <tr><td>来ます</td><td>来て</td></tr>
    <tr><td>行きます</td><td>行って</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

助数詞のメタル (Josuushi no Metal - Japanese Counters Metal song)
=========================================================

Apart from Kanji, counting things is definitely one of the toughest things in
the Japanese language to learn. You need to remember which counter to use for
what sort of things, how and which numbers change depending on the counter, and
counting just various measures of time on its own is a hard nut to crack. Based
on personal experience, I think there are 2 things that are easy to remember:
song lyrics after listening to them a few times and things of which one has
taken handwritten notes. I can't help with the latter, but I try my best to
cover the former.

I'd like to say thank you to 真紀 for reviewing the lyrics.

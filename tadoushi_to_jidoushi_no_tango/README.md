他動詞と自動詞のタンゴ (Tadoushi to Jidoushi no Tango - Transitive and Intransitive Tango/Vocabulary)
=======================================================================

Transitive and intransitive verb pairs in the Japanese language: which "open"
to use when you want to say "I open the window" and which one do you need when
you want to state that "The window is open"? Memorizing verb pairs like these,
when a lot of them don't seem to follow any patterns, requires a lot of
practice and hard work. Or does it? Let's find out if music can help with that!

I'd like to say thank you to [真紀さん][Maki], [Junさん][Jun] and

A case study in musical steganography, involving the following techniques to
hide an insult in the recording:

 * notes that make letters on the sheet music
 * notes that make letters on the fretboard of the guitar
 * a riff which is played on the guitar using a common hand gesture
 * a Morse code based riff
 * the F Dm C C Dm chord progression in G minor, which starts to resemble a
   hidden message when the Dm is written with Roman numeral (v) if you squint
   your eyes hard enough
 * a noise which reveals the message on its spectrogram
 * a message can also be heard if the recording is sped up a lot (around 10x)
   or reversed

Recording is available at [SoundCloud][sc].

Synths were made in [LMMS][lmms], guitar recording and mixing were done in
[Reaper][rp].

Scores can be viewed and edited using [MuseScore][ms].

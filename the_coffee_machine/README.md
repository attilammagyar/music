The Coffee Machine
==================

A song inspired by and featuring the sound of the coffee machine at the office.
:-)

Recording is available at [SoundCloud][sc].

Drums and synths (backing track) were made in [LMMS][lmms] and rendered into
individual tracks, which were then mixed with the recorded guitars and with
additional noises and effects (mostly compression, reverb and delay) in
[Reaper][rp]. Before opening the LMMS project, make sure to set the `LMMS
Working Directory` in `Edit/Settings` to the `lmms` directory inside the git
repository.

Scores for the guitar tracks can be viewed and edited using [MuseScore][ms].
For convenience, a PDF version is also available.
